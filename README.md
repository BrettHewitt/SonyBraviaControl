C# Library to control a Sony Bravia TV over the network

To enable this library to work, you must enable Remote Start on your tv and configure a Pre-Shared Key, as follows:

Enable remote start on your TV: [Settings] => [Network] => [Home Network Setup] => [Remote Start] => [On]

Enable pre-shared key on your TV: [Settings] => [Network] => [Home Network Setup] => [IP Control] => [Authentication] => [Normal and Pre-Shared Key]

Set pre-shared key on your TV: [Settings] => [Network] => [Home Network Setup] => [IP Control] => [Pre-Shared Key] => Assign a key of your choice

Give your TV a static IP address, or make a DHCP reservation for a specific IP address in your router
